DJSON is a JSON decoder for Go that is ___2~ to 3~ times faster___ than
the standard `encoding/json` and the existing solutions, when dealing with
arbitrary JSON payload. [See benchmarks below](#benchmark).  
It is a good approach for people who are using `json.Unmarshal` together
with `interface{}`, don't know what the schema is, and still want good
performance with minimal changes.

### Motivation
While searching for a JSON parser solution for my projects, that is faster than the standard library, with zero reflection tests, allocates less memory and is still safe(I didn't want the `"unsafe"` package in my production code, in order to reduce memory consumption).  
I found that almost all implemtations are just wrappers around the standard library
and aren't fast enough for my needs.  
I encountered two projects: [ujson](https://github.com/mreiferson/go-ujson) that is the UltraJSON implementation
and [jsonparser](https://github.com/buger/jsonparser), that is a pretty awesome project.  
ujson seems to be faster than `encoding/json` but still doesn't meet my requirements.  
jsonparser seems to be really fast, and I even use it for some of my new projects.  
However, its API is different, and I would need to change too much of my
code in order to work with it.  
Also, for my processing work that involves `ETL`, changing and setting new
fields on the JSON object, I need to transform the `jsonparser`
result to `map[string]interface{}` and it seems that it loses its power.

### Advantages and Stability
As you can see in the [benchmark below](#benchmark), DJSON is faster and allocates less
memory than the other alternatives.  
The current version is `1.0.0-alpha.1`, and I'm waiting to hear from you
if there are any issues or bug reports, to make it stable.  
(comment: there is a test file named `decode_test` that contains a [test case](https://github.com/a8m/djson/blob/master/decode_test.go#L104) that
compares the results to `encoding/json` - feel free to add more values if you find they are important)  
I'm also plaining to add the `DecodeStream(io.ReaderCloser)` method(or `NewDecoder(io.ReaderCloser)`), to support stream decoding
without breaking performance.


### Benchmark
There are 3 benchmark types: [small](#small-payload), [medium](#medium-payload) and [large](#large-payload) payloads.  
All the 3 are taken from the `jsonparser` project, and they try to simulate a real-life usage. 
Each result from the different benchmark types is shown in a metric table below.
The lower the metrics are, the better the result is.
__Time/op__ is in nanoseconds, __B/op__ is how many bytes were allocated
per op and __allocs/op__ is the total number of memory allocations.  
Benchmark results that are better than `encoding/json` are marked in bold text.  
The Benchmark tests run on AWS EC2 instance(c4.xlarge). see: [screenshots](https://github.com/a8m/djson/tree/master/assets)
